# Title: Revamping AtliQ Grands' Revenue Strategy: A Data-Driven Success Story

In the fast-paced world of luxury hotels, AtliQ Grands faced revenue challenges that threatened its market share. As an aspiring Data Analyst, I embarked on a journey to transform the fortunes of this prestigious 5-star hotel chain in India.

Here's a quick glimpse of some noteworthy facts about AtliQ Grands:

‚û°Ô∏èAtliQ Grands proudly stands as a five-star hotel chain with a presence in four bustling cities.

‚û°Ô∏èAcross these urban hubs, AtliQ Grands boasts a network of seven distinct properties, strategically situated to cater to diverse clientele.

‚û°Ô∏èWithin these upscale properties, guests are offered a choice of four room categories: Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard, ensuring a tailored experience for every visitor.

‚û°Ô∏èTo enhance guest convenience, AtliQ Grands offers reservations through six prominent booking platforms, optimizing accessibility and ease of booking.

**Project Scope:**
My mission was clear - to harness the power of data and provide insights that would pave the way for smarter decision-making at AtliQ Grands. To achieve this, we leveraged several datasets:

**dim_date** - This table contains date-related information, such as dates, week numbers, and day types (weekend and weekday). We utilized this data to analyze booking trends over time.

**dim_hotels** - This table provided crucial details about the properties, including property ID, property name, category, and cities. It was essential for understanding the hotel chain's properties and their characteristics.

**dim_rooms** - This table included information about room IDs and room classes. We used this data to analyze which types of rooms were more popular or profitable.

**fact_aggregated_bookings** - This fact table contained data related to property ID, check-in dates, room categories, successful bookings, and capacity. It served as a crucial source for calculating key metrics related to bookings and occupancy.

**Key Revelations:**

**‚ñ∂Total Revenue:** A staggering 1.71 billion rupees! üí∞

**‚ñ∂Highest Revenue City:** Mumbai, contributing 40% of the total revenue.

**‚ñ∂Top-rated City:** Delhi, boasting an impressive average rating of 3.8.

**‚ñ∂Luxury vs. Business:** Luxury category reigns supreme, generating a whopping 1053 million rupees.

**‚ñ∂Star Performer:** AtliQ Exotica property emerged as the hero, raking in a remarkable 320 million rupees in revenue.

**‚ñ∂Room Class Leader:** Elite rooms were the preferred choice among guests, showcasing their popularity, which we identified using data from the dim_rooms table.

**‚ñ∂Platform Power:** Makeyourtrip emerged as the revenue powerhouse among the booking platforms.

**‚ñ∂Hotel Performance:** AtliQ Exotica led the pack with 320 million rupees in revenue, while AtliQ Seasons, identified from the dim_hotels table, held its ground at 66 million rupees.

**‚ñ∂RevPAR Showdown:** AtliQ Exotica took the lead with an impressive 7.8k RevPAR, while AtliQ Grands followed closely at 6.5k.

**‚ñ∂ADR (Average Daily Rate):** AtliQ Seasons triumphed with an ADR of 16.6k, whereas AtliQ Blu, also from the dim_hotels table, stood strong at 11.9k.

These insights are not just numbers; they are the roadmap to revitalizing AtliQ Grands' revenue strategy. With Mumbai as a revenue stronghold and Delhi as a top-rated city, targeted marketing efforts can be focused here. The popularity of Elite rooms suggests a need for tailored promotions, while Makeyourtrip's dominance points to a lucrative partnership opportunity.

AtliQ Exotica's stellar performance highlights the potential for replication across other properties, leveraging data from the fact_aggregated_bookings table. Moreover, optimizing ADR at AtliQ Blu can further boost revenue.

In conclusion, data intelligence has unlocked a world of possibilities for AtliQ Grands. By leveraging these insights, the hotel chain can regain its competitive edge and secure its position as a leader in the luxury/business hotels category.
